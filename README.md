# Hack The Future - Python Stream

Welcome to the hackathon! Here you will find the Jupyter notebook with all the guidance you'll need to progress through the day. You'll also have the .parquet file that contains the data you'll need to work with.

If anything is unclear, ask GitHub Copilot...! Or our wonderful coaches!

Have fun. :)
